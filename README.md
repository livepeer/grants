# Livepeer Grants

Livepeer has a long term vision to build a fully decentralized video stack, and we cannot achieve this goal without a community of contributors to the project. Livepeer Grants provides funding to projects, ideas and events that benefit the Livepeer ecosystem. The grants program provides contributors with an opportunity to fund their projects and build a position in the Livepeer network. Livepeer Grants aims to distribute upto $250,000 in grants each quarter with semi annual review phases. 

If you're appreciative of this initiative and all that it will do for the ecosystem, stake with our orchestrator node, and contribute a portion of your inflationary reward to go towards these grants! *Node address: 0x4f4758f7167b18e1f5b3c1a7575e3eb584894dbc*

**How do I apply?**
* Submit an [issue](https://github.com/livepeer/Grant-Program/issues/new/choose). Product-based proposals must include specs in the submission. 
* Include mockups, technical milestones, and time estimates. When in doubt breakdown milestones further. 
* Application will be reviewed by Livepeer Grants, which meets bi-weekly to discuss all on-going and proposed grants. (If you are interested in joining Livepeer Grants, ping @nelson, @shann, @adam, or @ericxtang in the #community-grants [Discord](https://discord.gg/cmpB7sH) channel.) 
* Feedback will occur throughout the grant process 

**Grants Application Guideline**

* **Measurable result**: There should be success metrics for the grant proposal. The success metrics measure the impact on the community.
* **Achievable**: The proposal should be feasible - and sufficient research should be done ahead of time for its feasibility. If itâ€™s a research grant, a well-formed problem statement should be included.
* **Demonstration of capability**: The grant proposal party should demonstrate sufficient experience to successfully achieve the end goal outlined in the proposal. Prior experience in a similar area is highly preferred.
* **Impact for Livepeer**: The grant proposal should have a direct impact on the success of Livepeer and its community. The grant should be impactful to the success of the proposal.
