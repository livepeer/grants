# Livepeer Grants

Livepeer has a long term vision to build an open source and  fully decentralized video stack, and we cannot achieve this goal without a community of contributors to the project. Livepeer Grants provide funding to projects that benefit the Livepeer ecosystem.

Grants are paid in Livepeer token (LPT), providing contributors with an opportunity to both fund their projects AND build a position in the Livepeer’s Proof of Stake network. To receive a grant you will need a wallet that can receive funds on Arbitrum. We encourage grant holders to become delegators in the Livepeer network by staking their token with a Livepeer node operator to receive inflationary Livepeer rewards.

If you're appreciative of this initiative and all that it will do for the ecosystem, stake with our orchestrator node, and contribute a portion of your inflationary reward to go towards these grants! Node address: **0x4f4758f7167b18e1f5b3c1a7575e3eb584894dbc**.

After LPT is withdrawn from the staking pool in the community node, it is administered by the community grants committee via the multisig address arb:0x64e0aA4631ae8f74627e68Cf02565Bec30d2EA4F.

## Requirements

Requirements for ALL GRANTS:

- Projects must be open source
- Showcaseable
- We are open to funding projects built by teams or individuals, although it helps to have both product/UX + backend for the apps. Find people with complimentary skill sets to join you and collaborate by joining Discord and posting in the #web3-app-ideas channel.
- Grants must be achievable within a 3 month timeline
- Projects must display a "Powered by Livepeer" watermark, when applicable, to their application. It must be visible while a viewer is watching the video, whether that's in the player itself or in another location that would be easily seen by a viewer.

## Grant Types

There are 3 types of grants to support supply and demand for Livepeer’s open video infrastructure. Please choose the one most appropriate for you.

### Microgrants - up to $2,000 USD

Microgrants are geared towards tightly scoped projects with a clear deliverable that can be completed in 1 month or less. Examples of such projects may be:

- Hackathon participants who want to complete a feature using Livepeer 
- Existing projects looking to polish their Livepeer integrations with a well-defined sprint
- Educational guides/tutorials/videos targeted at a specific audience teaching them how to build with Livepeer.
- Contributions to Livepeer documentation

### Video Disruptor grants - up to $15,000 USD

The Video Disruptor grant is intended for dedicated teams looking to conduct cutting-edge video research and/or explore novel, user-centered web3 applications that leverage Livepeer’s decentralized video compute network. We are interested in teams looking to apply tools like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, AR/VR, etc to video in a web3 context. We also are interested in teams utilizing other web3 protocols and concepts like FVMs, zK-proofs, etc to create entirely new video experiences and tooling.

We will also consider projects that either disrupt or offer entirely new video experiences vs incumbent, web2 applications. However, teams must demonstrate the ability to engage the community (ideally the team or project already has a large existing community) in a meaningful way to foster fast adoption, growth, and feedback. 

Projects must be completed within 3 months or less with clearly defined monthly milestones.

### Open Livepeer Network grants 

Open grants will be awarded to individuals and teams building tooling and applications to support supply-side node operations, delegation and overall health of the Livepeer Network. Examples of past open network grants include bots for better governance, educational content on how to get started as an Orchestrator or Delegator, tools to better parse/debug logs, etc.

## How to apply

1. Submit an [issue](https://github.com/livepeer/Grant-Program/issues/new/choose). Product-based proposals must include specs in the submission. Include mockups, technical milestones, and time estimates. When in doubt breakdown milestones further. 
2. Application will be reviewed by Livepeer Grants, which meets bi-weekly to discuss all on-going and proposed grants. (If you are interested in joining Livepeer Grants, ping @hansy, @shann, @adam, or @ericxtang in the #community-grants [Discord](https://discord.gg/cmpB7sH) channel.) Applications will receive a decision for funding within 2-4 weeks of applying.
3. Approved grants will receive 20% of the total grant value upfront, followed by graduated payments in the form of milestone completions. Payment is made in LPT (on Arbitrum) based on the USD value of the milestone. The price of LPT used to make the payments is determined using a rolling 30-day average from the time the transaction is queued.
4. Feedback will occur throughout the grant process 

## Grants Application Guideline

- **Measurable result**: There should be success metrics for the grant proposal. The success metrics measure the impact on the community.
- **Achievable**: The proposal should be feasible - and sufficient research should be done ahead of time for its feasibility. If it’s a research grant, a well-formed problem statement should be included.
- **Demonstration of capability**: The grant proposal party should demonstrate sufficient experience to successfully achieve the end goal outlined in the proposal. Prior experience in a similar area is highly preferred.
- **Impact for Livepeer**: The grant proposal should have a direct impact on the success of Livepeer and its community. The grant should be impactful to the success of the proposal.
