# The Livepeer Grant Program

Since Livepeer's mainnet launch, and weâ€™ve seen an incredible amount of participation from the community. Livepeer has a long term vision to build a fully decentralized video stack, and we cannot achieve this goal without a community of contributors to the project. The Livepeer Grant Program provides contributors with grants ranging from 300 - 3000 LPT (subject to change). The grant program provides contributors with an opportunity to build a position in the network.

If you're appreciative of this initiative and all that it will do for the ecosystem, stake with our orchestrator node, and contribute a portion of your inflationary reward to go towards these grants! *Node address: 0x4f4758f7167b18e1f5b3c1a7575e3eb584894dbc*

**Grant Amount Range:** 300-3000 LPT

**We are seeking projects and will provide grants for:**
* Pricing Tools: Tools and guides to help enable orchestrators and broadcasters monitor and compare off chain pricing (like an ETHgastation for Livepeer).
* Developer Guides: Tutorials and guides that showcase how to use the Livepeer public network in an application
* Transcoder Pools: The Streamflow proposal introduces the idea of public transcoding pools that operate under the purview of an Orchestrator. Help make this a reality.
* Orchestrator Infrastructure Tools: Tools to help orchestrators better monitor and manage their transcoding infrastructure
* GPU transcoding & Mining Operation Tools
